automysqlbackup (2.5-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes the --opt issue with the information_schema that needs --skip-opt
    instead of --opt (Closes: #550037).
  * Added ${misc:Depends}.
  * Added patch to purge the rotated weekly backups that are older than 5
    weeks, if you selected SEPDIR (Separate backup for each DB), thanks to
    Gregor Hoffleit <flight@debian.org> (Closes: #572642).
  * Removes verbosivity when doing rm when LATEST is in use, as suggested
    by Frédéric Brière <fbriere@fbriere.net> (Closes: #574479).

automysqlbackup (2.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Recommends: mutt (Closes: #532402).
  * Now uses a SHOW DATABASES statement to list all DBs to backup in the
    /etc/defaults/automysqlbackup, which is a lot more reliable than the
    previous folder listing (Closes: #539370).
  * Added some quotes in the script to avoid some parsing errors, which
    was reported by a user of the package (Closes: #534852).
  * Added more comments in the /etc/defaults/automysqlbackup.
  * Added a watch file.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.2.

  * Backups are not world readable anymore (chmod 600 after the backup is
    performed). Thansk to jacques-billard@studio-jibe.com for reporting.
